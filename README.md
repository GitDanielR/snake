I made the Snake game in Python using pygame. There are a few bugs where the snake can split or the body will randomly decide it is too long and
split its tail. These issues might be related to an issue between the frame rate of the game and the rate at which it is trying to update
the snake. Although I am not sure. And this issue is not interesting so I will not try and fix it. This was a fun game to make and not too hard.
